# Designer & Developer — Local site

This is a small static site scaffold with a profile, About section, and Services. Each service card links to a dedicated detail page.

How to use
- Open `index.html` in your browser (file is at the repo root).

PowerShell example:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\ASUS TUF\Desktop\ms_canvaas"
Start-Process .\index.html
```

Edit the Instagram link and handle by updating the `href` and handle text in `index.html` and the service pages. Replace the placeholder avatar at `index.html` with your profile image.
